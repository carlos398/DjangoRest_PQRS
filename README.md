# First of all we must create our virtual env using the following commands in the CMD

    - virtualenv env (or we can use) python -m venv env

# now we activate the virtual env 
    - on linux ( source env/bin/activate )

    - or on windows with ( env/scripts/activate )

# the next step is to install the requirements

    they are in the requirements.txt file if you want to see what you are going to install take a look there
    now to install the packages we need to use the command (with env virtual activate)
